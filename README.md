Python Assignment 3 for Bootcamp

# Description
Python scripts for two separate data files - one for banking analysis and one for voting

In the first file, we are reading from the budget_data.csv file to find the following information and print it to a .txt file.

In the second file, we are given poll data from a file called election_data.csv and run the program to find the winner of the election. We then print this to a .txt file in the analysis folder.
